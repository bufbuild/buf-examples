# Using Protovalidate in Kafka with Bufstream

This directory contains companion code for the [using Protovalidate in Kafka with Bufstream quickstart][documentation], where you can learn to add Protovalidate to a Go streaming application powered by Bufstream:

1. Adding the Protovalidate dependency.
2. Annotating Protobuf files.
3. Regenerating code.
4. Enabling validation in the broker.

Its `start` directory is the starting state for code exercise, and `finish` contains a working solution.
