# Protovalidate in gRPC and Java

This folder contains companion code for [the Protovalidate in gRPC and Java quickstart][documentation], where you learn to add Protovalidate to a Java RPC powered by gRPC:

1. Adding the Protovalidate dependency.
2. Annotating Protobuf files and regenerating code.
3. Adding a gRPC interceptor.
4. Testing your validation logic.

This folder contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
