# Protovalidate Quickstart (Python)

This directory contains companion code for the [Protovalidate quickstart][documentation], where you learn to:

1. Add Protovalidate to schemas.
2. Generate code.
3. Run validations.

Its `start` directory is the starting state for code exercise, and `finish` contains a working solution.
