# Compiling Protovalidate annotations with the Buf CLI

This directory contains example code for [compiling with the Buf CLI documentation][documentation], where you can learn to compile Protovalidate-annotated schemas using the Buf CLI.

It's a working example: `buf generate` should immediately run without errors.
