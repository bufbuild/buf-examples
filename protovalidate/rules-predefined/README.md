# Using Protovalidate: Predefined rules

This directory contains companion code for [predefined rules documentation][documentation], where you can learn to refactor repeated Protovalidate rules into reusable predefined rules:

1. Create a rule file.
2. Extend a rule message to create a predefined rule.
3. Use your predefined rule.

It contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
