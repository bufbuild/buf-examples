# Using Protovalidate: Predefined rules

This directory contains companion code for [predefined rules documentation][documentation], where you can learn to refactor repeated Protovalidate rules into reusable predefined rules:

1. Create a rule file.
2. Extend a rule message to create a predefined rule.
3. Use your predefined rule.

Its `start` directory is the starting state for code exercise, and `finish` contains a working solution.
