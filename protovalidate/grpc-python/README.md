# Protovalidate in gRPC and Python

This directory contains companion code for [the Protovalidate in gRPC and Python quickstart][documentation], where you learn to add Protovalidate to a Python RPC powered by gRPC:

1. Adding the Protovalidate dependency.
2. Annotating Protobuf files and regenerating code.
3. Adding a gRPC interceptor.
4. Testing your validation logic.

Its `start` directory is the starting state for code exercise, and `finish` contains a working solution.
