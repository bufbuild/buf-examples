# Bufstream and Iceberg quickstart

This folder contains example code for Bufstream's [Iceberg quickstart](https://buf.build/docs/bufstream/iceberg/quickstart/).
It walks through the key tasks for creating a local Bufstream and Iceberg environment:

1. Deploying a Docker-based Bufstream environment with local object storage and Iceberg REST catalog.
2. Configuring Bufstream and a topic for Iceberg archival.
3. Running the Iceberg archival process on demand.
4. Querying Iceberg with Apache Spark and a Jupyter Notebook.
