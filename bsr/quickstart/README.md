# Buf Schema Registry quickstart

This folder contains example code for the [Buf Schema Registry (BSR) quickstart][docs].
It introduces you to key features of the BSR:

1. Managing dependencies
2. Creating and publishing modules
3. Adding documentation
4. Using generated SDKs as an API consumer

This folder contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
