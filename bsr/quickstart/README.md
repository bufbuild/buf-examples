# Buf Schema Registry quickstart

This folder contains example code for the [Buf Schema Registry (BSR) quickstart](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/quickstart/).
It introduces you to key features of the BSR:

* Managing dependencies
* Creating and publishing modules
* Adding documentation
* Using generated SDKs as an API consumer

This folder contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
