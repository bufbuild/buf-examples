# Buf plugins

This folder contains example code for the [Create a Buf Plugin quickstart][docs].
It introduces how to define your own rules in a Buf plugin and how to install and use it locally by:

1. Writing a simple plugin
2. Adding options to a rule
3. Adding a breaking change rule to the same plugin
4. Using the `Default` property

This folder contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
