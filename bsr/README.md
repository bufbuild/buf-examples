# Buf Schema Registry examples

The Buf Schema Registry (BSR) is the missing package manager for Protobuf, allowing you to manage schemas, dependencies, and governance at scale.

Supplementing its [documentation], this repository provides quickstart code exercises and reference examples for its use.

## Buf Schema Registry quickstart

[Quickstart code](quickstart) for the Buf Schema Registry's [Quickstart][quickstart] introduces you to key features of the BSR, including managing dependencies, creating and publishing documented modules, and using generated SDKs. It contains a `start` directory with a starting state and `finish` with a working solution.
