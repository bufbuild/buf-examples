# Buf on GitHub Actions example

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-examples/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-examples/actions?workflow=CI)

This example project shows you how to use Buf in a [GitHub Actions][actions] setting.
This uses the [Buf Action][buf-action].

> The configuration for [GitHub Actions][actions] is in the [`.github`](../.github) directory in the root, as that's where GitHub expects it to be.
