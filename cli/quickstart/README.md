# Buf CLI quickstart

This directory contains example code for the [Buf CLI quickstart][docs].
It walks through the key workflows of the CLI:

1. Configuring and building a workspace
2. Generating code
3. Linting an API
4. Detecting breaking changes
5. Implementing an API

It contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
