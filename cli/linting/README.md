# Linting quickstart

This directory contains example code for the Buf CLI's [linting quickstart][docs].
It walks through the key tasks for using linting to maintain code quality and consistency in your projects:

1. Running `lint`
2. Fixing lint errors
3. Customizing lint configuration
4. Temporarily ignoring lint errors

It contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
