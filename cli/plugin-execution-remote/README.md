# Remote plugin execution

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have the [`buf` CLI][install] installed to follow along with this example.

This directory contains example code for Buf's [generating code with remote plugins tutorial][docs], where you can learn to generate code stubs from a [Buf input][input] using Protobuf plugins. 

Here, we'll use two remote plugins hosted on the [Buf Schema Registry][bsr]:

Plugin | Language
:------|:--------
[`protocolbuffers/go`][pb-go] | [Go]
[`protocolbuffers/java`][pb-java] | Java

You can use the [`buf` CLI][cli], in conjunction with the configuration in [`buf.gen.yaml`](./buf.gen.yaml), to generate code stubs from any valid [Buf input][input]. Let's try it with the [`buf.build/buf-examples/observabilityapi`][api] module from the [workspace] example:

```sh
buf generate buf.build/buf-examples/observabilityapi
```

The [remote plugin execution][blog] was designed to avoid the pitfalls of using [locally installed plugins][local].
