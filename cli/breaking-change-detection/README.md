# Breaking change detection quickstart

This directory contains example code for the Buf CLI's [breaking change detection quickstart][docs].
It walks through the key tasks for running breaking change detection locally using common use cases:

1. Comparing against a local Git repository
2. Comparing against the Buf Schema Registry (BSR)
3. Comparing against a remote Git repository

It contains a `start` directory, where you work on the example files, and a `finish` directory that you can use to compare against.
